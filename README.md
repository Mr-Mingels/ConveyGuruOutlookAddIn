<p>This Outlook Add-In was developed as part of an assessment. It enables users to interact with their Microsoft email accounts within the Outlook interface. Users can log in to their Microsoft email accounts. Once they're logged in, they can then select the specific mail folder they wish to view. Once they've selected their folder, or all of the folders, the add-in then displays all emails contained within the selected folder.

## Tech stack used for developing the Web Application :

1. Frontend: Vue 3 and JavaScript.
2. Backend: Node and ExpressJS.

## Installation/Steps to Run this web application

Step 1. Clone the repository to a new folder on your local machine using Git.

```text
git clone https://github.com/Mr-Mingels/ConveyGuruOutlookAddIn.git
```

Step 2. Open the "ConveyGuruOutlookAddIn" folder

```text
cd ConveyGuruOutlookAddIn
```

Step 3. Install project dependency with npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)

```text
npm i
```

or

```text
yarn install
```

Step 4. Running the application

```text
npm start
```

or

```text
yarn start
```

After running the application, it might prompt you to log into a Microsoft account. If this occurs, simply log in using whichever Microsoft account you feel comfortable with.


Step 5. Adding the Add-in into your Add-ins (Video)

To complete step 5, you must first download the raw manifest.xml file from this GitHub repo. Once you've done that, simply follow along with the video below:

Once you've added the add-in to your add-ins, you can then freely use it as you please, as long as you're still running the application locally. Here's a video of me using the application with one of my work emails:
